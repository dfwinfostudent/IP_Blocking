This is a list of IP's and subnets that I've observed doing one thing or another that offended me. Therefore, I don't want them talking to my hosts any longer. Use this list as you will, but please give credit when you do as I've spent a lot of time trawling my logs from around the interwebs to create it. Currently the list is very simple. It's a list of CIDRs that I parse during host build and on other occasions to update my firewalls. 

TODO: Make it a CSV or something similar that can be parsed automatically during host build and read by humans to include both a reason and a nethost and/or ASN for each of the blocks.

I can be reached on the twitter and here via my handle, DFWInfoStudent.
